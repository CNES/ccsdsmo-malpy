"""The activity tracking service provides the ability to monitor the progress of activities; an activity is anything that has a measurable period of time (a command, a remote procedure, a schedule etc). It defines an event pattern that supports the monitoring of activities from the initial consumer request, tracking its progress across a transport link, to reception by the provider and execution in that provider."""
