"""The group service provides a mechanism for other services to reference sets of their own objects using a single group reference. These groups are used by the other MC services (such as Action, Alert, Check, Aggregation and Parameter) to reduce the complexity of operations by allowing consumers to reference groups of objects (such as parameters) in operations rather than having to supply large lists of object references.
Where operations of other service mention the use of groups in their operations, any reference to a group object instance identifier implicitly means a GroupIdentity object.
Groups of other groups is supported, however all objects within the group of groups should have the same object type as most operations expect a single type.
The creation of cyclic group of groups should also be avoided.
The group service does not provide any operations directly, but allows consumers to add, remove, and modify groups via the COM archive."""
