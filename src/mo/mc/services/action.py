"""The action service allows consumers to submit an action for execution and to subsequently monitor the execution progress of these actions via the COM activity tracking pattern. The progress of the action is split into two parts, firstly transfer from the consumer to the provider, and secondly execution in the provider.
An action is submitted to the provider using the submitAction operation, the progress of which can be monitored using the COM activity tracking pattern, which completes when the action has been delivered to the provider. The action is then executed in the provider which can also be monitored using the activity tracking pattern. The submitAction operation takes the object instance identifier of the submitted action and uses that to populate the source fields of the activity tracking events. Coordination may be required between action service consumers to ensure the action object instance identifiers are unique. How this is done is outside the scope of this specification however a good approach is the use of a central COM archive as that can provide the unique instance identifiers.
The nominal sequence of action submission and execution monitoring are shown in Figure 3-1:
 insert sequence diag here 
The consumer is responsible for creating and archiving the action instance object and then using the submitAction operation to submit it to the action provider for execution. The action provider reports, using the COM ActivityTracking service, both the execution progress of the submitAction operation and also the execution of the action itself. Once the supplied action instance details have been checked and execution of the action started by the submitAction operation, that operation finishes, whilst the execution of the action possibly continues (depends on the actual action). The final interaction in the sequence shows the execution events of the executing action instance, the '*' at the start of that line indicates zero to many events being published.
If the execution of an action fails with an error, the action service provider can publish an ActionFailure COM event to hold the error code being reported by the failure. If no error code is required to be reported then there is no need to publish the event as the normal COM ActivityTracking event contains a success indication.
The service also includes an operation, preCheckAction, which checks that an action would be accepted for execution without actually submitting it for execution. It is expected to be provided by local action proxies, rather than the remote system, to allow for localised checking of things such as link state, argument values, action safety, before sending the action over long and slow space links.
The action service defines three types of objects, the first type is the ActionIdentity object that holds the name of an action. The second type is the ActionDefinition object that holds the description of an action with the list of required/optional arguments. The third type is the ActionInstance object that holds details of a specific action instance namely a value for each of the arguments of the action."""
